# GitGithub-Intro
A brief introduction to Git/Github for those interested in learning more about how and when to use it. The material included was developed for a professional development workshop at the Tulane H-TML.
The workshop is divided into three sections: An introduction, a hands on activity using Github, and a demonstration by the instructors of the steps necessary to edit and add files.  The intruction explains what Git and Github are and they relate.  Included are examples, cheat sheet terms and an example of a simplified workflow.  The hands on portion has the particpiants create a Github account, explore the interface, learn the terms used (e.g. fork, clone, pull request, etc.) and fork a reposisotory from the Howard-Tilton-Library organization. Following the exploration of the interface, the instuctors demonstrate basic functions within the Github (e.g. edit, commit and pull requests).
